# ===== project targets =====
# The overnight loop's commit gate is `make check`. It MUST verify the repo
# OFFLINE + DETERMINISTICALLY — no network, same result every run — because that
# is what makes unattended overnight runs safe to commit on.
#
# NOTE: `npm run build` / `npm start` run `node fetch.js` first, which hits the
# GitHub + Medium APIs (ONLINE). Those are deliberately NOT part of the gate.
# `make smoke-local` compiles the production bundle directly, bypassing fetch.js,
# so it stays offline.

.PHONY: check test format lint smoke-local

# Offline + deterministic commit gate: render-smoke test suite (jsdom, no network).
check:
	CI=true npx react-scripts test --watchAll=false

# Alias kept for convention.
test: check

# Offline smoke: compile the production bundle WITHOUT the online fetch.js step.
# CI is left unset so eslint warnings don't fail the smoke (the gate is `check`).
smoke-local:
	npx react-scripts build

# --- non-gating helpers (not run by the loop) ---
format:
	npm run format

# Pre-existing format issues + generated build/ artifacts make this red at
# baseline, so it is intentionally NOT part of the gate.
lint:
	npm run check-format

# ===== overnight harness targets (append to your Makefile) =====
# The overnight runner + helpers are the Single Source of Truth in the overnight-harness
# PLUGIN; this repo does NOT vendor them. These targets resolve the installed plugin at
# runtime and invoke its runner against THIS repo. Per-repo STATE stays here:
#   scripts/overnight/overnight-settings.json  — Claude permission boundary
#   scripts/overnight/opencode.json            — opencode permission boundary
#   .codex/rules/overnight.rules               — Codex command rules
#   scripts/overnight/PROMPT.md                — optional per-repo prompt override (else plugin default)
#   scripts/overnight/{logs,STOP,DONE}         — runtime state
#
# The loop's commit gate is $GATE_CMD (default `make check`). Define a `check` target that proves
# correctness OFFLINE + DETERMINISTICALLY and allow-list it in scripts/overnight/overnight-settings.json.
#
# Select the engine with ENGINE=claude|codex|opencode|agy. Default stays Claude.
ENGINE ?= claude

# HARNESS_ROOT resolution (env override → per-repo pin → highest installed version). This mirrors
# the plugin's bin/harness-locate.sh; override ad hoc with `make overnight HARNESS_ROOT=/path`.
